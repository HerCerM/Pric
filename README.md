# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Pric: Print Code

The goal of this tool is to provide an easy way to produce a PDF out of a set of code files.

| ‚Ñπ | Pric is slow, it takes some seconds to print the usage help and a bit longer to produce the PDF. |
|---|:---|

## Usage

Given the following project, we can generate a PDF out of the Java files.

```
.
`-- src
    |-- META-INF
    |   `-- MANIFEST.MF
    `-- hercerm
        `-- iindices
            |-- app
            |   |-- ApplicationStarter.java
            |   `-- WordSearcherApplication.java
            |-- core
            |   |-- FileContentCleanser.java
            |   |-- IIValue.java
            |   |-- IIndexGenerator.java
            |   |-- REPL.java
            |   |-- REPLCommands.java
            |   |-- TXTCleanser.java
            |   `-- WordSearcher.java
            `-- util
                |-- FileDownloader.java
                |-- PathsAccessor.java
                `-- Serializer.java

```

To create the PDF, simply run:

```bash
pric output_file.pdf -re java
```

Which produces `output_file.pdf`, with a cover page, syntax highlighted code listings and a table of contents shown by the PDF reader:

<p align="center">
    <img width=720px src="images/non_compact_demo.png">
</p>

## Options

```
$ pric -h

Print multiple source code files to a single PDF file.

pric [OPTIONS] file

Parameters:
      file                Filename of the PDF, must end in '.pdf'.

Options:
  -a, --author=<author>   Author of the document.
  -c, --compact           Produce a PDF with more code per page and no cover
                            page.
  -e, --extensions=<ext>[,<ext>...]
                          Extensions of the files to be printed.
  -f, --files=<regex>[:<regex>...]
                          Match filenames by regex.
  -h, --help              Show this help message and exit.
  -k, --keep-asciidoc     Preserve AsciiDoc file after PDF generation.
  -p, --paths=<path>[?<path>...]
                          Absolute or relative paths to directories to search
                            for files (default is current dir)
  -r, --recursive         Recurse sub-directories.
  -s, --silent            Do not show log messages.
  -t, --title=<title>     Title of the document. If omitted, filename is used.
  -V, --version           Print version information and exit.

Exit codes:
  0    Successful PDF generation.
  1    No PDF was generated.

Examples:
Notice that the default title of every document is the provided filename
(in the examples below, the title of most documents is 'out'). To set an
appropriate title different from the filename, use the option -t, as shown
in the example 3.

1. Include all Java and XML files on the current dir and its sub-dirs.
pric out.pdf -r -e java,xml

2. Include all Markdown files and the LICENSE file found on the current
directory.
pric out.pdf -e md -f 'LICENSE'
Notice the single quotes around LICENSE. Always use single quotes around the
arg value of -f, to avoid the shell from evaluating the expression.

3. Include all SQL files in current dir and add cover page with title and
author.
pric out.pdf -e sql -a 'Hernan Cervera' -t 'Database design'

4. Include all SQL files in current dir and remove cover page from PDF.
pric out.pdf -e sql -c
```

- By default, the PDF generated has one file per page. If you are dealing with many small files, this might not be ideal. The `--compact` option generates a PDF with no cover page, no ToC, and attempts to place more files per page.
- If you would like to further customize the PDF, for example by adding a paragraph or some other information, you can use `--keep-asciidoc` to preserve the AsciiDoc file and manually edit it as you will. Then it is simple to generate your PDF by using [`asciidoctor-pdf`](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf#install-the-published-gem).

## Requirements

- Groovy 3
- Java 8

## Installation

### Linux

Download **[Pric](./pric)** and provide execution permission:

```
chmod +x pric
```

To have the script globally available, copy it to `/usr/local/bin`.

### Windows

1. Make sure you have a shell which supports Bash, e.g. [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).
2. Download **[Pric](./pric)** and you are done.
3. (Optional but recommended) Make the script globally available by configuring your `PATH` environment variable.
